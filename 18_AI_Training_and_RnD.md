# 🧠 AI-Driven Training & Research Development (R&D)

## **📌 Overview**
AI should be embedded into **every aspect of research, training, and employee development** at Login, Inc. **Every unknown thought process must go through AI first**—forcing AI to act as an **always-on, 24/7 research assistant** for every employee.

This ensures:
✅ Employees **think with AI first** before jumping to conclusions.  
✅ AI becomes **an extension of their thought process**, **not a separate tool**.  
✅ **Training & R&D become hyper-accelerated**, reducing research time **by 80-90%**.  

> 💡 **Analogy:**  
> Just like **basketball players train their non-dominant hand**, employees must **train their AI cognition**—AI should be **their left hand, always in play.**
